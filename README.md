# MERN Stack Food Delivery App

This project is a **MERN stack food delivery application** that I built while following [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/DBMPXJJfQEA?si=mglYxeMFUV74m5GQ). The goal was to gain hands-on experience with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack by developing a full-stack web application.

## Overview

The application includes features such as a responsive food delivery frontend, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, order placement, an admin panel, and payment integration using Stripe. The backend integrates with MongoDB Atlas for database operations.

## What I Learned

By following the tutorial, I gained practical experience in:

- Designing and building a **responsive frontend** for a food delivery website using React.
- Creating user authentication features, including **login and registration**.
- Integrating a shopping cart and implementing **order placement functionality**.
- Developing a backend using **Node.js and Express.js** for handling API endpoints.
- Setting up and managing a **MongoDB Atlas database** for data storage.
- Building an **admin panel** to manage the application's content, such as food lists and user orders.
- Fetching and displaying data on the frontend from the backend using **RESTful APIs**.
- Implementing **Stripe payment integration** for secure transactions.
- Managing and updating user orders from the admin panel.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.
